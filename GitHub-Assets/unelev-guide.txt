.SYNOPSIS
    Quickly open a New Non-Admin PowerShell Session at your Current Directory
.DESCRIPTION
    WARNING, EXECUTING THIS COMMAND MAY ALLOW A SOPHISTICATED THREAT ACTOR TO GAIN ELEVATED PERMISSIONS (by modifying unelev's code)
    EXERCISE CAUTION

    *Unelev is a command from the PowerShell-File-Walker Commands Bundle
    Unelev works only on Windows devices

    Unelev means "Unelevate", and refers to "Unelevating (revoking) Permissions"
    Unelev opens a New PowerShell Session at your Current Directory that has User (Non-Admin) Permissions

    Unelev can be used inside Admin and Non-Admin PowerShell Sessions

    The steps:
    1. You use Unelev
    2. Unelev takes a Snapshot of your Current Working Directory in your Current PowerShell Session
    3. Unelev opens a New Non-Admin PowerShell Session
    4. Unelev loads the PowerShell-File-Walker Commands Bundle to the New Non-Admin PowerShell Session, because it heavily depends on it
    5. Unelev starts taskbar flashing for the New Non-Admin PowerShell Session
    6. Unelev sets the Working Directory of the New Non-Admin PowerShell Session to the directory from the Snapshot
    7. If everything went well - Unelev will write a message in the Old PowerShell Session about its success

    Unelev Aliases:  nudo (short for "No Sudo")
    Use  'Get-Help unelev -Examples'  or  'Get-Help unelev -Full'  for more information
.PARAMETER ExitCurrentSession
    Should Unelev use the "Exit" command in the Current PowerShell Session after launching the New Non-Admin PowerShell Session?
    ExitCurrentSession Aliases:  e  q  ex  qu  exit  quit

    If Unelev fails - the "Exit" command will NOT be used
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> unelev
    *Unelev opened a New Non-Admin PowerShell Session with 'C:\Users\Jacob' as the working directory*
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> unelev -ExitCurrentSession
    *Unelev opened a New Non-Admin PowerShell Session with 'C:\Users\Jacob' as the working directory*
    *Unelev closed the Old PowerShell Session because everything went well*
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> unelev -ExitCurrentSession
    *Unelev fails*
    *Nothing is closed and nothing happens because Unelev failed*
.NOTES
    Unelevation method: Windows Task Scheduler - Scheduling a one-time task to start PowerShell. Then immediately calling the scheduled task - then deleting that task. Please read the code for more info
