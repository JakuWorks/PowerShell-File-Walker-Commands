.SYNOPSIS
    Quickly open a New Admin PowerShell Session at your Current Directory
.DESCRIPTION
    WARNING, EXECUTING THIS COMMAND MAY ALLOW A SOPHISTICATED THREAT ACTOR TO GAIN ELEVATED PERMISSIONS (by modifying elev's code)
    EXERCISE CAUTION

    *Elev is a command from the PowerShell-File-Walker Commands Bundle
    Elev works only on Windows devices

    Elev means "Elevate", and refers to "Elevating (giving) Permissions"
    Elev opens a New PowerShell Session at your Current Directory that has Admin Permissions

    Elev can be used inside Admin and Non-Admin PowerShell Sessions

    The steps:
    1. You use Elev
    2. Elev takes a Snapshot of your Current Working Directory in your Current PowerShell Session
    3. Elev opens a New Admin PowerShell Session
    - Elev may ask you for admin permission if it cannot open a New Admin PowerShell Session
    4. Elev loads the PowerShell-File-Walker Commands Bundle to the New Admin PowerShell Session, because it heavily depends on it
    5. Elev starts taskbar flashing for the New Admin PowerShell Session
    6. Elev sets the Working Directory of the New Admin PowerShell Session to the directory from the Snapshot
    7. If everything went well - Elev will write a message in the Old PowerShell Session about its success

    Elev Aliases:  wudo (short for "Windows Sudo")
    Use  'Get-Help elev -Examples'  or  'Get-Help elev -Full'  for more information
.PARAMETER ExitCurrentSession
    Should Elev use the "Exit" command in the Current PowerShell Session after launching the New Admin PowerShell Session?
    ExitCurrentSession Aliases:  e  q  ex  qu  exit  quit

    If you cancel the Admin Permission Ask Prompt - the "Exit" command will NOT be used
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> elev
    *Elev asks for admin permission* - *You allow it*
    *Elev opened a New Admin PowerShell Session with 'C:\Users\Jacob' as the working directory*
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> elev -ExitCurrentSession
    *Elev asks for admin permission* - *You allow it*
    *Elev opened a New Admin PowerShell Session with 'C:\Users\Jacob' as the working directory*
    *Elev closed the Old PowerShell Session because everything went well*
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\Users\Jacob> elev -ExitCurrentSession
    *Elev asks for Admin Permission* - *You cancel it*
    *Nothing is closed and nothing happens because Elev failed*
.NOTES
    Elevation method: Start-Process -RunAs. Please read the code for more info
