    C:\Program Files>

    1'st found 1 or more recognized characters - WhichByAlphabet
    2'nd found 1 or more recognized characters - Times

    Each group of recognized characters is separated by one or more unrecognized characters
    This allows Stick Mode to differentiate between WhichByAlphabet and Times

    All recognized characters:
    - Special characters -> q, l, ...
    - Digits -> 0, 1, 2, ...
    - Commas -> ,
    - Most math characters -> * / + - ( ) .
    All other characters are unrecognized!
    Space is an Unrecognized character!

    Stick Mode allows you to define both WhichByAlphabet and Times
    Other parameters like -WriteSelectedFiles must be defined BEFORE entering a Stick session

    Stick Mode supports advanced WhichByAlphabet and Times input
    Negative numbers, special characters, math characters, and so on...

    Examples Template:
    'text' => Role => Description

    Option: 2,3 4,5
    '2,3' => WhichByAlphabet => 1'st found recognized characters
    ' ' => unrecognized characters => ends the 1'st found recognized characters group
    '4,5' => Times => 2'nd found recognized characters

    Option: hi 1,-1,b,1,5 hello 6,7
    'hi ' => unrecognized characters => ends nothing
    '1,-1,' => WhichByAlphabet => 1'st found recognized characters.  Note: the , comma at the end is ignored
    'b' => unrecognized character => ends 1'st found recognized characters group
    ',1,5' => Times => 2'nd found recognized characters. Note: the , comma at the beginning is ignored
    ' hello ' => unrecognized characters => ends 2'nd found recognized characters group
    '6,7' => Ignored => 3'rd found recognized characters


            #9 Config
