Before proceeding to read the below information please acknowledge.
- The script is currently unstable

---


### A fatal flaw was found in the design choices of the script - the settings are directly inside the script - this means that with every update, the User's settings would have to be manually moved. Luckily there is ongoing work to fix this :tada:.

*The current solution idea*

A brave engineer as stood up to fill the need - the settings will be moved to a separate config.ps1 file *(name may change)* - the User will overwrite the default configuration there - the config.ps1 will be directly loaded with the . *dot* operator, overriding the default configuration included in the main file.

This solution may add just a few ms to the loading time - but no noticeable changes.

A throughout online documentation will be absolutely necessary - the config.ps1 contains the overrides defined by the Users, so it's blank by default.

A GitHub wiki is planned.

Everything will change...
